# Setup
install nodejs from: https://nodejs.org/en/download
personally I like to check the "install automatically" box 
for setting up additional tooling as necessary

pay attention to what it installs, 
knowing your local stack and stack versions can save hours of headache.

you will also need to perform a system restart after it finishes

# angular8-frontend
only works via:

cd C:\dev\angular8-frontend
npm install
npm run start

# SampleProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.9.

## Development server

Run `npm run serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

You will need to run the selenium test suite at https://github.com/JudeaDumont/SeleniumWithCucucumber
